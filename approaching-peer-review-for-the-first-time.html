<h1>Approaching peer review for the first time</h1>

Many of us PhD students will be on the receiving end of a peer review, but <a href="https://twitter.com/danjlurie/status/737972014233718785">it's equally valuable to review articles ourselves</a>.
Last year, I received several rounds of extremely helpful reviews on <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0226.1">my first journal article</a> and, earlier this year, I had the chance to review an article myself.  I've been reflecting on how I can perform better reviews so that, one day, my reviews might be as helpful as those I received for my own article:

<dl>
  <dt><b>The big picture</b></dt>
<dd>
I'm quite good at improving the details of a manuscript: Are variables defined? Are figures presented clearly?  Are references formatted correctly?
But it's harder to see the big picture: is the research valuable and is it novel?  Are the experiments suitable or are there more appropriate methods in existing literature?  Are the results sufficient to convince you that the author's conclusions are true?
There will be other, more experienced academics reviewing the paper, too, so I'm not worried if I can't address all of these questions completely.
</dd>

<dt><b>What's missing?</b></dt>
<dd>
It's easy to review what's in front of you, but I find it much harder to identify what's missing: Does the introduction need to cover a broader range of topics from previous literature?  Would you need more information to reproduce the author's results?  Are there additional figures or additional experiments that would strengthen the conclusions?  Again, I hope that answering such questions will become easier to answer with more experience.

<dt><b>Are you done?</b></dt>
<dd>
The journal editor will give you guidance on what they expect from your review and I used this as my <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/10/8-steps-to-a-definition-of-done-in-jira/">definition of done</a>.  I also applied <a href="http://eloquentscience.com/">David M. Schultz's advice on editing</a>: once I start reverting revisions to my review, it's probably time to stop.  Finally, you might like to add your review to <a href="https://publons.com/">publons</a> and start tracking your own review statistics.

<p>Expect to set aside a few days if you want to review a journal article, so <a href="http://jonathanpeelle.net/blog/2016/5/19/how-many-manuscripts-should-you-be-reviewing">don't say yes to everything</a>.  But you can also perform internal reviews for colleagues in your department, or get involved in open reviews on <a href="https://thewinnower.com/">The Winnower</a>.
I found that reviewing is a great way to get myself to read critically and look forward to writing more reviews in future.</p>
