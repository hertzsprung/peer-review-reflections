I'm a PhD student at the University of Reading, England, and I'm just starting to learn about academic publishing and peer review.  I received several rounds of extremely helpful reviews on my first journal article last year and, earlier this year, I had the chance to review an article myself.  I've been reflecting on how I can perform better reviews so that, one day, my reviews might be as helpful as those I received for my own article:


- too easy to focus on the details: spelling, grammar, variables defined, clearly-presented figures, referencing
- easy to reviewer what's in front of you but harder to see what's missing:
  - would different experiments be more convincing?
  - does the introduction need to cover a broader range of topics from previous literature?
  - what is the potential value of the research and is it novel?  has this been made clear, or has it perhaps been overstated?
- harder to get a big picture:
  - is there sufficient breadth of background?
  - are the experiments appropriate?  are there more suitable experiments in existing literature?
  - are the results enough to convince you of their conclusions?
- more obvious stuff:
  - set aside enough time (I read the manuscript 3-4 times over the course of ~3 weeks)
  - use editor's guidelines to help you critique, and follow their suggested structure

- wrap up: 
  - once you're done, consider adding your review to publons
  - peer review is a great way to force you to read critically and get practice doing so
